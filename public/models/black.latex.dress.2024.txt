"description": "In January 2024, I visited the National Museum in Oslo, where I encountered a work that deeply resonated with me. Inspired by this piece, I resolved to reinterpret it as a dress. The result is a garment crafted from black, white, and natural latex, utilising advanced 3D modelling and traditional pattern cutting, all meticulously hand-assembled.",
