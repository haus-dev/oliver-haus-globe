"description": "Following my graduation from London Metropolitan University, I was approached by Edward Crutchley for a collaboration. Commissioned to develop latex garments for his London Fashion Week show in September 2023, I received a series of 2D illustrations from Edward as the starting point. I translated these concepts into toile prototypes to refine the shape, before constructing the final garment. Crafted from natural-coloured latex with black latex trim at the hem, the piece involved a combination of 3D CAD modelling, pattern cutting, and meticulous hand assembly. The completed dress was subsequently presented at London Fashion Week September 2023",
