  "description": "The scarlett.bag came about during a tutorial session at the Royal College of Art with Scarlett, Tristan, and Anna. After Tristan suggested that I start working with clients, I decided to focus on Scarlett as my first collaborator. I looked into Scarlett's public digital data and spoke with her directly about her preferences, which shaped the final design. Using perspex, 3D print, leather, and fabric, I combined digital tools like 3D modelling, laser cutting, and Zund cutting with hand assembly to create a personalised piece that connects both our interests and skills.",
