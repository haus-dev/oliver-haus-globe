  "description": "I created the 'xd.bag' to explore different shapes and materials. Made at the Royal College of Art, Darwin Building, the bag combines leather, perspex, Japanese paper, 3D prints, and canvas. I used a mix of digital and manual techniques, including 3D modelling, laser cutting, Zund cutting, and hand assembly. This project was a straightforward experiment in material and form.",
