  "description": "This piece, called 'avant.garde', was part of my graduate collection. I wanted to create an architectural shape around the body, using materials that are lightweight but allow for large volume, like carbon fibre, 3D PLA print, and organza. I used pattern cutting, composite work, 3D modelling, and hand assembly to bring the design to life.",
