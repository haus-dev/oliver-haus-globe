  "description": "fish.bag is the result of a collaboration between me and Skinned Potential. They provided fish leather and together we turned it into a finished bag. The project came about from a shared interest in trying new materials and making something by hand. Made at the Royal College of Art, the bag uses fish leather, cardboard, 3D printed parts, and vegetable-tanned leather. The process included 3D modelling, laser and Zund cutting, and hand assembly.",
