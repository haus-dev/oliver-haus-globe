"description": "This dress is the third in a series of intricate garments. Conceived as a purely technical undertaking, the piece features a corset constructed from glass fibre and leather, from which wool drapes. The creation required a precise blend of composite work, pattern cutting, and woodwork, with each element assembled by hand.",
